Functions are objects containing a set of instructions.<br>
When you pass a tuple of argument(s) (possibly an empty tuple) to them, you get one or more values as output.

## Operators

Operators are functions and can be written in a way that shows the tuple of arguments more explicitly:

```{julia}
3 + 2 == +(3, 2)  # `==` tests for equality
```
```{julia}
+(3, 2)
```
