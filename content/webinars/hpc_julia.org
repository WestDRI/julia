#+BEGIN_definition
Julia is fast: just-in-time (JIT) compilation and multiple dispatch bring efficiency to interactivity. People often say that using Julia feels like running R or python with a speed /almost/ comparable to that of C.

But Julia also comes with parallel computing and multi-threading capabilities.

In this webinar, after a quickly presentation of some of the key features of Julia's beautifully concise syntax, I will dive into using Julia for HPC.
