/Installing Julia on your machine is entirely optional as you can run everything on the training cluster. If you would like to practice on your machine in addition to (or instead of) the training cluster, this lesson will guide you through the setup of your machine. Please note that we won't be debugging local installations./

* Julia

Download the current [[https://julialang.org/downloads/][Julia stable release]] and follow the [[https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/][installation instructions]] corresponding to your operating system.

To write scripts, you will also need a capable text editor.\\
