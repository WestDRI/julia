* Important note

If you have issues installing Julia and/or some packages, please sign up for the [[https://westgrid-julia.netlify.app/school/jl-06-debug.html][debug session]] to make sure that you have a running installation before our next Zoom meeting (we will not have time to debug installation issues during that meeting).
