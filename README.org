This is the repo for Marie-Hélène Burle's old site on [[https://julialang.org/][Julia programming language]] training material for WestDRI.

All worthwhile content has been moved to [[https://github.com/WestDRI/arc-training][the new repo]] for [[https://mint.westdri.ca/][Marie's new site on training material]].

All new content will be added to that new site.
