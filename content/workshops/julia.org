Why would I want to learn a new language? I already know R/python.
#+END_quote

R and python are interpreted languages: the code is executed directly, without prior-compilation. This is extremely convenient: it is what allows you to run code in an interactive shell. The price to pay is low performance: R and python are simply not good at handling large amounts of data. To overcome this limitation, users often turn to C or C++ for the most computation-intensive parts of their analyses. These are compiled—and extremely efficient—languages, but the need to use multiple languages and the non-interactive nature of compiled languages make this approach tedious.

Julia uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation: the code is compiled at run time. This combines the interactive advantage of interpreted languages with the efficiency of compiled ones. Basically, it feels like running R or python, while it is almost as fast as C. This makes Julia particularly well suited for big data analyses, machine learning, or heavy modelling.

In addition, multiple dispatch (generic functions with multiple methods depending on the types of all the arguments) is at the very core of Julia. This is extremly convenient, cutting on conditionals and repetitions, and allowing for easy extensibility without having to rewrite code.

Finally, Julia shines by its extremely clean and concise syntax. This last feature makes it easy to learn and really enjoyable to use.

In this workshop, which does not require any prior experience in Julia (experience in another language—e.g. R or python—would be best), we will go over the basics of Julia's syntax and package system; then we will push the performance aspect further by looking at how Julia can make use of clusters for large scale parallel computing.

* Software requirements

*1_ A terminal emulator and an SSH client for remote access to clusters*

/Windows:/ \\
Install the free Home Edition of [[https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html][MobaXTerm]].

/MacOS:/ \\
Terminal and SSH are pre-installed.

/Linux:/ \\
You can use xterm or the terminal emulator of your choice.\\
If SSH does not come bundled with your distribution, install [[https://www.openssh.com/][OpenSSH]].

*2_ The current [[https://julialang.org/downloads/][Julia stable release]]*

*3_ A good text editor or the Julia IDE*

You will need a capable text editor (e.g. Emacs, Vim, Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Nano, Atom, Notepad++).\\
If you would rather play in the Julia IDE, you can find the installation instructions [[http://docs.junolab.org/latest/man/installation][here]].

* Introducing Julia

** Background

*** Brief history

Started in 2009 by Jeff Bezanson, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Karpinski][Stefan Karpinski]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_B._Shah][Viral B. Shah]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Edelman][Alan Edelman]], Julia was launched in 2012 as free and open source software. The 1.0 version was released in 2018.

[[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] developer Graydon Hoare wrote an interesting [[https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/189377.html][post]] which places Julia in a historical context of programming languages.

*** Why another language?

**** JIT

Computer languages mostly fall into two categories: *compiled languages* and *interpreted languages*.

***** Compiled languages

Compiled languages require two steps:

- in a first step the code you write in a human-readable format (the source code, usually in plain text) gets compiled into machine code

- it is then this machine code that is used to process your data

So you write a script, compile it, then use it.

[[/img/compiled_language.png]]

Because machine code is a lot easier to process by computers, compiled languages are fast. But the two step process makes direct interaction with the code impossible.

Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, Fortran, Go, and Haskell.

***** Interpreted languages

Interpreted languages are executed directly. This has many advantages (direct interaction with the code, dynamic typing, etc.), but it comes at the cost of efficiency. The source code can facultatively be bytecompiled into non human-readable, more compact, lower level bytecode which is read by the interpreter more efficiently.

[[/img/interpreted_language.png]]

Examples of interpreted languages include R, Python, Perl, and JavaScript.

***** JIT compiled languages

Julia uses [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation][just-in-time compilation]] or (JIT): the source code is compiled at run time. This combines the flexibility of interpretation with the speed of compilation, bringing speed to an interactive language. It also allows for dynamic recompilation, continuous weighing of gains and costs of the compilation of parts of the code, and other on the fly optimizations.

Of course, there are costs here too in the form of overhead time to compile code the first time it is run and increased memory usage.

**** Multiple dispatch

opt-in type checking

Conveniently, all packages are on GitHub and they can easily be searched [[https://pkg.julialang.org/docs/][here]].

* Hands-on

using Distributed
nprocs()
nworkers()

** Working with Julia locally


** Working with Julia on the cluster

Now that we have a running script, let's submit a job to the cluster.

*** Log in to the cluster

Open a terminal emulator (also called shell or command line interface).

/Windows users, launch [[https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/][MobaXTerm]].\\
MacOS users, launch the program "Terminal"./

#+BEGIN_src sh
ssh userxxx@cassiopeia.c3.ca

# enter password
#+END_src

You are now in our training cluster.

*** Access Julia

This is done through the [[https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Utiliser_des_modules/en][module]] command.

#+BEGIN_src sh
# get help on the module command
module help
module --help
module -h

# list modules that are already loaded
module list

# see which modules are available for Julia
module spider julia

# see how to load julia 1.3
module spider julia/1.3.0

# load julia 1.3 with the required gcc module first
# (the order is important)
module load gcc/7.3.0 julia/1.3.0

# you can see that we now have Julia loaded
module list
#+END_src

source /project/shared/syncHPC/startJulia.sh
julia


module load gcc/7.3.0 julia/1.3.0
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH="julia:@v#.#:@stdlib:/project/shared/bio"
export JULIA_LOAD_PATH=$JULIA_LOAD_PATH:/project/shared/bio



*** Write Julia script which can be run from the command line

#+BEGIN_export html
Save your script in the file <span style="font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', monospace; font-size: 1.4rem; padding: 0.4rem; box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); border-radius: 5%; background-color: #f0f3f3; color: #000000">julia_script.jl</span>.
#+END_export

#+BEGIN_src julia
# install necessary packages
import Pkg
Pkg.add(["", ""])


#+END_src

*** Job script

#+BEGIN_export html
Save your Slurm job script in the file <span style="font-family: 'Source Code Pro', 'Lucida Console', monospace; font-size: 1.4rem; padding: 0.4rem; box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); border-radius: 5%; background-color: #f0f3f3; color: #000000">job_script.sh</span>.
#+END_export

#+BEGIN_src sh
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=julia		# job name
#SBATCH --time=00:01:00			# max walltime
#SBATCH --mem=100M				# max memory
#SBATCH --output=julia%j.out	# file name for the output
#SBATCH --error=julia%j.err		# file name for errors
# %j gets replaced with the job number

# load necessary modules
module load gcc/7.3.0 julia/1.3.0

# run our Julia script
julia julia_script.jl
#+END_src

We submit our job with:

#+BEGIN_src sh
sbatch job_script.sh
#+END_src

And we can check its status with:

#+BEGIN_src sh
sq
#+END_src
