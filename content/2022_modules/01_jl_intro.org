- Linux, WSL, and MacOS type in your terminal:

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ ssh userxxx@beluu.c3.ca
# enter password (it is blind typing, so you won't see it as you type)
#+END_src

- Window users:

{{<a "https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/demo.html" "This demo">}} shows how to use SSH with MobaXterm (for "Remote host" enter: ~uu.c3.ca~).

* Running Julia in a job inside the training cluster

** Load the Julia module

To see which versions of Julia are available on the cluster:

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ module avail julia
#+END_src

We will load the latest Julia (julia/1.7.0) which is the default

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ module load julia              # not mentioning any version loads the default
#+END_src

** Start an interactive job

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ salloc --time=03:00:00 --mem=7482
#+END_src

** Launch Julia

Finally, we can launch the Julia REPL by running the `julia` command:

#+BEGIN_src sh
$ julia
#+END_src

* JupyterHub access

For this course, we will also use a temporary JupyterHub. Here is how to log in:

- Go to {{<a "https://beluu.c3.ca" "https://beluu.c3.ca,">}}
- Sign in with the username & password you just got,
- Set the server options according to the image below,
